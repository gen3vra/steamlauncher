# Steam Launcher
Quickly and simply launch any steam game!

### Why would I want this?
I needed a program that was small to launch steam games so that I could set custom properties to each .exe for start menu tiles.

### What are the advantages to launching games this way?
You can build your own custom shortcuts or whatever you want. All you have to do is place the .exe next to a text file with the steam app ID in it with the same name as the .exe. Then, make a shortcut to said .exe and put it anywhere you want! My folder where I keep the shortcuts for the above picture looks like this:

The program is only 6 kb. 

### What's a steam app ID?
You can find it by looking at the tail end of a steam game url.
For instance, CS:GO's app id is 730. The CS:GO steam URL looks like this:
https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/
You can see at the end of the URL that it has the ID.
